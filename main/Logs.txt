Project Log @ 2023.12.03

| Software |
1. Created Github Respository
2. Setup Overall Structure
3. Added Mapping Function for Testing Use (Only Controlling With Y-axis, With One Motor)
    --> To Solve the Direct Mapping Problem ---- Solved

-- Fill-Up --
1. Mis-connected Joystick to Digital Pin (Should be Analog)
2. Directly Mapping Joystick Read Value to PWM range ---- Unsolved
3. Wanted to Use Button as Switch, Turning On and Off for Controlling
    --> Solved, Used 2-element Array as Pair to do 2-Point Recording to Determine Button-Up
